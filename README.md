# Retail Access vs. Social Cost: Store Locations, Sales Trends, and the Measured Social Impact of Legal Cannabis in Canada

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project undertakes an in-depth, multi-faceted analysis of the legalized cannabis market in Canada. It focuses on the interplay between **retail infrastructure (store locations)**, **economic performance (sales trends)**, and **social impact (cannabis-related crime data)** since legalization.

The primary objective is to synthesize disparate public data sources from Health Canada and Statistics Canada into a cohesive, interactive analytical report. This report will address key questions about the rollout of legalized cannabis, its commercial footprint, and its measurable impact on crime statistics across Canadian provinces and territories.

## 💻 Analytical Views (Key Deliverables)

The analysis will focus on generating the following key views and insights:

1.  **Store Locations Master List:** A compiled and geo-coded master list of all licensed stores (Province, City, Postal Code) for centralization and public release.
2.  **Crime Trends Visualization:** Temporal analysis of cannabis-related crimes (by offense type) since legalization, using time-series charts.
3.  **Crime vs. Density Correlation:** City-level comparison of normalized store density (per capita/km²) against crime rates to quantify retail saturation impact.
4.  **Location Mapping:** Interactive city-level maps displaying precise store locations to provide spatial context for the density analysis.
